What is ChatGPT Max?

The idea is simple, ChatGPT Max is a customized version of ChatGPT that is built with custom scripting (python) to achieve things you never thought about with traditional ChatGPT, even with GPT-4 or ChatGPT Plus.

The current prototype of ChatGPT Max Allows us to do the following:

Search Google and Do small research based on live results.
Rewrite text with one command.
Summarize blog posts with one command.
Ability to add more commands (in code)
Set Custom Models Like GPT-3.5-16K.
Token and Cost Estimation.
Set Custom Temperature and Top_p.

I used the latest streamlit chat components to build a simple, clean UI for this ChatBoT.
